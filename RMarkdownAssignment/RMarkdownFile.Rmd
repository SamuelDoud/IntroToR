This is an *R Markdown* document. It is used to **document** R code.

* Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
  + consectetur adipiscing elit.
  + ut feugiat lorem facilisis mi scelerisque pretium.
* Donec sit amet massa massa.

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit
2. Donec dolor urna
    + ultrices sed semper at
    + malesuada at magna
3. Nam viverra. <-- ~~What would allow this to continue the list?~~ Seems you shouldn't use the 1. numbering for ordered lists


<span style="color:red">Here is an example of text coloring. Seems like HTML.</span>

Equations are created just as in LaTeX.
    $\pi = \frac{A}{\sqrt{r^{4}}}$
    
Code is generated by wrapping the code in '`' and beginning the code with 'r'.
For example 12! = `r factorial(12)`.

##### I think this what the assignment means by 'session info'.
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

#### This is a plot of included R data with the code exposed.

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
```
